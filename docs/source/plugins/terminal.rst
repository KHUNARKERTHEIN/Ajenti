Plugin terminal
***************

It would be really cool to have an terminal access on the server. That's exactly what this plugin does!

You have the possibility to launch a command (and naturally see the result) or to open a whole terminal on the server. You will get the same environment as your user on the system.

Type exit or Ctrl + D to come back to the terminal list.

Hotkeys
=======

 * Ctrl + C : copy
 * Ctrl + V : paste
 * Ctrl + D : exit
