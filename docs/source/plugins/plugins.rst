Plugin plugins
**************

``Ajenti`` is pretty flexible and allow anyone to write its own plugin (backend ``Python`` and frontend ``AngularJS``).

In order to manage all plugins and their versions, the plugin ``plugins`` lists all available plugins, shows if they are installed, or if an update if published.

The main plugin ``core`` can not be uninstalled, because ``Ajenti`` can not run without it, but you can check whenever a new version is available.

Updating or removing a plugin is this way pretty easy.
